 PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Following our initial analysis, we are given an additional assignment. Using ou Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we needd to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Once all these steps are completed, we will be able to see how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

Our first assignment was to create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data provided initially by city type. We first had to make the following calculations:

- The total rides for each city type. 
- The total drivers for each city type. 
- The total amount of fares for each city type.
- The average fare per ride for each city type.
- The average fare per driver for each city type.

Once these calculations were completed, we were able to create the following Pyber summary DataFrame which combines the results:

Our second assignment was to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. This was done using the following code after creating a weeky DataFrame of the date stamped records in 2019:

We were able to create the line graph below:
